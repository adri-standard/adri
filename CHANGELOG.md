No unreleased changes.

## [4.1.4] - 2025-06-10

**Note:** This release supersedes v4.1.1, v4.1.2, and v4.1.3 due to TestPyPI tombstone restrictions and release workflow fixes. Core functionality is identical to v4.1.1, with Python 3.13 support added.

### Added
- **Python 3.13 Support**: Added compatibility with Python 3.13 (released October 2024)
  - Updated CI/CD test matrices to include Python 3.13
  - Added Python 3.13 classifier to package metadata
  - All 822 tests passing on Python 3.13 across Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
  - Closes #48

### Fixed
- **Issue #35 Regression**: Restored CLI/Decorator parity after test consolidation
  - Re-implemented `standard_path` tracking in AssessmentResult for transparency
  - Updated DataQualityAssessor to capture and pass standard file path used
  - Fixed ValidationPipeline to properly propagate standard_path parameter
  - Enhanced CLI to display which standard file was used in assessments
  - Updated audit logging to include `standard_path` in all CSV logs
  - Added `TestStandardPathConsistency` to prevent future regressions
  - Updated ADRI audit log standard YAML with new `standard_path` field
  - Ensures CLI, Decorator, Config, and Audit logs all use identical standard paths

### Changed
- Enhanced diagnostic logging in DataQualityAssessor and ValidationPipeline
  - Added detailed INFO-level logging for standard loading and dimension scoring
  - Helps users debug assessment issues and understand scoring process
  - Controlled via standard Python logging configuration

## [4.1.0] - 2025-05-10

### Overview
First public release of ADRI (AI Data Reliability Intelligence) - a comprehensive data quality framework for AI applications.

### Added
- Complete framework integration support for major AI frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI)
- Comprehensive security policy and GitHub community templates
- Production-ready documentation with GitHub Pages deployment
- Enhanced test coverage with 816 passing tests across multiple platforms

### Fixed
- **Issue #35**: Resolved CLI vs Decorator assessment consistency
  - Fixed discrepancy where identical data and standards produced different quality scores
  - Both CLI and decorator now use unified assessment and threshold resolution
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for consistency validation

### Changed
- **Governance Enhancement**: Simplified standard resolution to name-only approach
  - Decorator now accepts only standard names (not file paths) for improved security
  - Standard file locations determined by environment configuration (dev/prod)
  - Ensures centralized control and prevents path-based security issues

Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Fix CI Essential workflow test paths

- Update pyproject.toml testpaths to point to development/testing/tests
- Update CI Essential workflow to run core unit tests instead of examples/demos
- Replace incorrect test commands with development/testing/tests/unit/ execution
- Resolves systematic CI failures blocking PR merges

This fixes the core issue where CI Essential was running example/demo tests
instead of comprehensive core unit tests, causing false CI failures.
